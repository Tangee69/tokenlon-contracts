# AllowanceTarget

The AllowanceTarget contract manages token allowances and authorizes specific spenders to transfer tokens on behalf of users.

## Security Considerations

AllowanceTarget provides a pause mechanism to prevent unexpected situations. Only the contract owner can pause or unpause the contract. In most cases, the contract will not be paused.
